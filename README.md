# Hangman Game

An interactive word game, where the user must try to guess a randomly generated word by guessing letters in the word. Each incorrect letter guess leads to a life deduction. 

If the player loses 6 lives, the game is over. 
If the player uncovers the word before using all six lives the user wins.

Good luck!
